Numbers
In this chapter, we will work with the most basic data type: numbers.

We'll cover the following

Print the Data Type
Basic Operations on Numbers
Numbers#
Start your Python REPL and write the following:

Print the Data Type#
To print the number data type, use the built-in function type(number):

12345
a = 2
print(type(a)) #print the data type of variable a

b = 2.5
print(type(b)) # prints data type of variable b

Output

<type 'int'>
<type 'float'>

Basically, you are declaring two variables (named a and b) which will hold some numbers; variable a is an integer number <type 'int'> and variable b is a real
number <type 'float'>.

Basic Operations on Numbers#
We can now use our variables or any other numbers to do some calculations:

a=2
b=2.5
print(a + b)  
print ((a + b) * 2)
print(2 + 2 + 4 - 2/3)

Output
4.5
9.0
8

Now that the basics of the numbers are clear, let’s check your knowledge in the upcoming exercises before moving on to the 'Strings’​ lesson.

A brief description of the previous operations’ functions is given below.

/   
// 
%
**
Division
Floor Division
Modulus
Exponentiation
Divides the number on the left with the number on the right
Divides and returns the integer value of the quotient
Divides and returns the value of the remainder
Raises the first number to the power of the second
